=> PYTHON PROGRAM

=====================

**#  RULES / INSTRUCTIONS FOR STUDENTS**

=> ALL PROGRAMS WORK IN REPEAT MODE AS PER USER'S CHOICE

=> BOTH LOOPS (WHILE \& FOR) ARE USED IN THE PROGRAM

=> SAFE PROGRAMMING PRACTICES ARE FOLLOWED

=> PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT CRASHES

=> BASIC EXCEPTION HANDLING IS IMPLEMENTED





=> HINDI VERSION ME

=======================

**#  RULES / INSTRUCTIONS FOR STUDENTS**

=> Program user ke choice ke hisaab se baar-baar (repeat mode) me chalna chahiye.

=> Program me dono loops — while aur for — ka use zarur karein.

=> Program likhte time safe programming practices follow karein.

=> Program ko aise design karein ki wo crash na ho (error hone par handle ho jaaye).

=> Basic exception handling (error control) ka use karein taaki program smoothly chale.
